Manthey Kit Performance Specs
911 GT3 RS (992): More than 2,200 lbs. of downforce at 177 mph
911 GT3 RS (992): Semi-active coilover suspension with revised spring rates
911 GT3 RS (992): High-performance brake system improves responsiveness
911 GT2 RS (991): Modified aerodynamic elements increase downforce
911 GT2 RS (991): Track-optimized, adjustable coilover suspension
911 GT2 RS (991): Stainless steel brake lines improve responsiveness
911 GT2 RS (991): Larger water tank offers longer refill intervals while lapping
Atlanta. Porsche today announced U.S. availability of Manthey Kits intended to further enhance two of the most track-focused 911 variants in recent times – the Type 992 911 GT3 RS currently in production, and the Type 991 911 GT2 RS, which was produced from model years 2018 to 2020.  

Type 992 911 GT3 RS: More than one ton of downforce at 177 mph
The Manthey Kit for the 911 GT3 RS is easy to spot thanks to its extensive aerodynamic modifications. The new front lip, which is supported by carbon fiber reinforcements, is much larger and has a new wing profile. This revision, along with revised Gurney flaps for the front wheel arches and dual dive planes attached to the left and right sides of the front fascia contribute to an increase in downforce at the front axle. The kit includes a carbon fiber panel that is installed in place of the rear window, bringing a 25 percent weight savings compared to the glass it replaces. A carbon fiber shark fin, which improves cornering stability and is inspired by the 963 World Endurance Championship-winning race car sits over the CFRP panel. Combined with six additional roof fins, the shark fin diverts hot air from the front radiator to promote cool air induction for combustion, even under extreme conditions. The split DRS rear wing – in conjunction with significantly larger wing-end plates – increases rear downforce at the rear axle. A significantly widened rear diffuser with longer carbon fiber fins adds downforce without increasing drag. Carbon fiber aero discs reduce drag and complete the aerodynamic package to optimize airflow. Overall, downforce increases by 20 percent with no additional drag. At 177 mph, the 911 GT3 RS Manthey Kit produces over 2,200 lbs. of downforce. This allows the driver to carry more speed while turning, especially through medium- and high-speed corners.`,
